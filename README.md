# VRProject-RetroHorror-LCain

## Project description: 

The game is a short sequence of several rooms, laid out in a non-euclidean pattern. The player must form a mental map of how the rooms connect by exploring, all while solving the various puzzles they will come across. More rooms open up as they gain access to new items, such as a lantern or a key. They will at times glimpse enemies and at one point be chased by one. There will be no combat, however. There are three NPCs they can talk to, who will provide hints and backstory, and progress what little story there is.


### Controls:

It’s controlled like a classic first-person game, with the Player in the shoes of the hero, who can move freely around the map. Movement is based on the left controller’s motion stick. The right controller’s stick switches between collected items and, in dialogue, selects a response. The right trigger activates the item where applicable (lighting the lantern, etc). Otherwise, the triggers are used to pick up physics objects. 


### Map:

The map is made up of several rooms which connect via doors. The doors aren’t linked in physical space, instead acting like portals – they can be told apart by their designs, which match the room they link to (the door with a square emblem and the same design as the square room’s wallpaper leads to the square room, for example). Every room has a vaguely Victorian design, with ambient colourful light and Low view distance. Darkness is so thick that in some rooms, you can’t see the opposite wall from one side.


### Sound:

The sound design, much like the graphics, are influenced by PSX era games such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil. It aims to create discomfort and anxiety by using low quality and often looping samples. 


### Rest API:

The Rest API integration will be used sparingly to increase its effect. Paintings will sometimes change to pictures of the player’s city or depict a map of their location. If it is raining, they may hear the sound of wind and water droplets hitting a window in one of the rooms. 

Characters: 

There are five characters: Eth, the player, a knight and royal guard. Thorne, her stoic comrade. Spots, a deranged cervine they picked up along the way – and Reno, a princess and the guards’ charge. Finally, the Warden is a supernatural foe who chases Eth during one sequence. Eth and Thorne are on a quest to rescue Eth, and somehow ended up in the game’s setting.

In game, Thorne will be used for exposition should the player require it. Spots will be used for providing cryptic hints as well as red herrings. The Warden will periodically appear to be watching Eth, and finally confront her before the ending. Reno will only appear once, at the end, serving as a final confrontation and puzzle that can resolve in one of two endings.

## Necessary setup/execution steps: 

Open project and enter play mode

## Third party material: 

Some textures are modified images used under Fair Use

## Project state: 

45 – 55% complete!

## To do:

High priority: inventory system, fully integrate all items and puzzles, functional doors

Mid priority: Dialogue system

Low priority: Enemy fight, ending

## Limitations: 

Needs VR device to be played. May make a non-VR port in future.

## Lessons Learned: 

Greatly improved C# as well as modelling skills; rapid asset production; Unity workflow
